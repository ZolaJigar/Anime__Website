        <P class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            Nezuko's original personality as a human was that of a kind and caring girl who thought of others before herself much like her older brother, Tanjiro. Additionally, she was a responsible elder sister to her younger siblings and often put their needs first rather than her own.[7][8] Nezuko is, however, not afraid to get in harm's way, protecting her friends from demons even after being returned to a human state. It is also shown that Nezuko's humane, laid-back demeanor supports this fact after Tanjiro apologized to her.

        <P class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            Kakashi Hatake is introduced as the Jonin (elite ninja) leader in charge of Team 7, a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. He first appears as a carefree character and tends to lose track of time, being frequently late to his appointments as a result.[19] However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point of fighting while reading Make Out (イチャイチャ, Icha Icha) series of erotic novels.[20] Kakashi is renowned throughout the Naruto world for the use of his Sharingan, which he received from his teammate Obito Uchiha, and is revered as the ninja who has copied over a thousand jutsus, earning him the moniker "Copy Ninja Kakashi" (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi) and "Kakashi of the Sharingan" (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi). The Sharingan grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others.</p> 
            <p>most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the Chidori (千鳥, lit. "One Thousand Birds") and its Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target. When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not take them as his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them.[24] Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha.[25] Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival.

        <P class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            Yuji first appears in Jujutsu Kaisen as an eccentric 15-year-old who lives with his grandfather Wasuke and is a member of his high school's occult club. On the day his grandfather passes away, Yuji is approached by jujutsu first-year sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, who inquires about one of Sukuna's fingers that the occult club illicitly obtained. Later, he comes to Megumi's rescue when a swarm of cursed spirits attack the school, attracted by the finger; in the process, Yuji ingests the finger. Jujutsu master and teacher at the Tokyo school Satoru Gojo tells Yuji that he is being planned for execution, but they delay the execution so that Yuji can eat all of Sukuna's fingers and rid the world of Sukuna entirely. Yuji moves in to the Tokyo school and beings learning jujutsu, mentored personally by Satoru. He quickly strikes up friendship with his fellow first-years, Megumi and Nobara Kugisaki. He seemingly dies during an altercation with a "curse womb" at a detention facility, wherein Sukuna blackmailed Yuji by holding his heart hostage.
